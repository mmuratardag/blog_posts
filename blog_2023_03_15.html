<h1>Sharing Knowledge, Not Hoarding It: Tackling Organizational
Silos</h1>
<div id="survey-results-from-stack-overflow-2022"
class="section level2">
<h2>Survey results from Stack Overflow 2022</h2>
<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>Is your organization caught up in a knowledge silos situation?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Knowledge silos in the workplace can lead to a lack of innovation and
productivity. When employees are isolated from each other, they are less
likely to share ideas and collaborate, leading to stagnation and missed
growth opportunities. Knowledge silos lead to a duplication of effort,
which is a waste of resources. When employees are not aware of what
others are working on, they tend to end up duplicating work that has
already been done, leading to inefficiency and wasted time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Knowledge silos are usually a result of lack of communication and
coordination. When employees are focused only on their own team’s goals,
they may not be aware of how their work impacts others in the
organization, leading to miscommunication and missed deadlines.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Even worse, knowledge silos lead to a lack of trust and a sense of
“us vs. them” mentality in the workplace. When different teams are in an
unhealthy competition and get caught up in knowledge silos, they may
begin to view each other with suspicion and resentment, leading to a
toxic work environment.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Tackling knowledge silos is essential for organizations that want to
remain competitive. To stay ahead of the curve, companies need to be
agile and able to respond quickly to changes in the market. This
requires collaboration and the free flow of information across
departments and teams.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-prevalent-are-knowledge-silos-in-the-tech-sector"
class="section level3">
<h3>How prevalent are knowledge silos in the tech sector?</h3>
<div>
<p>Stack Overflow’s annual community survey offers data on the most
frequently utilized technologies, tools, and frameworks within the
developer and data practitioner communities. The 2022 survey features
questions on attitudes towards knowledge silos and the frequency of
seeking assistance outside of the immediate team. Find out more at <a
href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022" target="_blank">here</a>. I
start by quoting the website:</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div>
<center>
<font size="2"> <strong><em>“Nearly half of all respondents report that
knowledge silos prevent them from getting ideas from across the
organization and that waiting for answers to questions often causes
interruptions and disrupts their workflow - with little difference
between independent contributors and people managers.”</em></strong>
</font>
</center>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div>
<p>Let’s go beyond this. The survey has &gt;73.000 participants. Though,
when filtered to actively working community members and removing the
missing values, you can get a sample of 25.642 individuals with various
job titles. The job titles and corresponding sample sizes are shown in
the figure below.</p>
</div>
<p><br> <img src="ws_img/ins_cul_sc1.png" alt="job titles" /></p>
<div>
<p>In addition to standard demographics such as age, gender, and
education level, the survey includes items on specific roles,
organizational size, years of experience, and mental health. Mental
health is operationalized as self-reported mood or emotional disorders,
anxiety disorders, learning disabilities, concentration problems, or
autism. If any of these conditions are reported, there is a mental
health issue; otherwise, not. The plot below shows the percentages of
participants with and without mental health issues across different
roles and organization sizes.</p>
</div>
<p><br> <img src="ws_img/ins_cul_sc2.png"

<p>The following variables went into the analysis.</p>

<p>I threw all these variables in a Bayesian learning network (BLN) to
determine the structural relationships. BLN is a powerful tool that
allows for modeling complex relationships between variables. In a
nutshell, the outcome outlines the causal skeleton of the mechanisms by
representing the probabilistic independencies/dependencies between
variables.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The following plot should make it intuitive. The nodes in the network
are the survey items; the edges are the parameterized relationships –
the coefficients are displayed with negative or positive signs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<iframe src="path_model_cont.html" height="800" width="1000" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay" data-external="1">
</iframe>
</div>
<p><font size="1"> BLM output displays the structural relationships
across variables. All paths show standardized coefficients. The layout
is optimized for coefficient visibility and cause -&gt; effect order. It
may look a bit cluttered at first glance but let me walk you through it.
Read on. </font></p>
<div>
<p>Let’s start with age, gender, and education level: they do not impact
anything whatsoever, so they are disconnected from the network.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The graph shows the three most central outcomes at the bottom. The
following three items have the highest incoming centrality measures in
the network (many other items in the network predict these items – these
are the most central outcomes).</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Needing help from people outside of your immediate
team</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Encountering knowledge silos</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>I often find myself answering questions that I already
answered before</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>The frequency of needing help from outside the immediate team is
somewhat neutral. More interaction outside the team has the strongest
positive association with this outcome. Yet, many paths lead to this
outcome; many are straightforward: i.e. managers have more frequent
contact outside their immediate team (very weak relationship, though
with a 0.03 coefficient). Knowing where to look has a weak negative
association (-0.05). These are negligible paths. The size of the
organization has an indirect negative (coefficients) path via “
<strong><em>I know which system or resource to use to find information
&amp; answers to questions I have</em></strong> ”. In other words, the
larger the organization, the harder it is to access relevant
information; however, the more you know about where to find the relevant
info, the less frequent contact you have outside of the immediate
team.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Though, the same outcome of the “ <strong><em>high frequency of
needing help outside of the immediate team</em></strong> ” also has a
dark side. This item is also predicted by the frequency of encountering
knowledge silos and having to wait for answers and workflow
interruptions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The frequency of encountering knowledge silos is the most central
outcome; it is predicted by 7 other variables in the network. There are
four strong predictors of this outcome, the strongest being the “
<strong><em>knowledge silos preventing individuals from getting ideas
across the organization</em></strong> ” item. Another strong positive
path is from “ <strong><em>frequency of interacting with people outside
of immediate team</em></strong> ” to the high knowledge silos
encountering frequency. Those who complain about having to wait for
answers and workflow interruptions are the ones encountering knowledge
silos frequently. Not being able to find quick answers to their
questions also leads to frequent knowledge silos barriers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Finally, the strongest path to “ <strong><em>I often find myself
answering questions that I already answered before</em></strong> ” is
again “ <strong><em>waiting for answers that cause workflow
interruptions</em></strong>”. “ <strong><em>Knowledge silos preventing
individuals from getting ideas across</em></strong> ” is the other
strong predictor of repeating oneself. Perhaps one other noteworthy
finding is that there is also a direct path from the independent
contributor vs. manager item to this self-repetition item, which
probably indicates that managers tend to repeat themselves more; my
guess is that managers do this for multiple stakeholders.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In short, these three central outcomes suggest that there is a lot of
wasted valuable time and effort in some of the work environments and
interactions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Let’s move on to the most central predictors (the items with the most
outgoing edges; causing multiple things). These are the following.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>I have interactions with people outside of my immediate
team</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>I am able to quickly find answers to my questions with
existing tools and resources</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Knowledge silos prevent me from getting ideas across the
organization</em></strong></li>
<li>Mental health</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Let’s again treat “ <strong><em>I have interactions with people
outside of my immediate team</em></strong> ” as a neutral statement and
focus on the other three.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Those who strongly endorse the “ <strong>I am able to quickly find
answers to my questions with existing tools and resources</strong> ”
statement are pretty high on “ <strong>I know which system or resource
to use to find information and answers to questions I have</strong> ”
and “ <strong><em>I can find up-to-date information within my
organization to help me do my job</em></strong> ”. Those who are quick
to find answers to their questions with existing tools and resources are
the ones who do not frequently encounter knowledge silos, they don’t
have to wait for answers, which cause workflow interruptions, and they
also don’t report that knowledge silos prevent them from getting ideas
across.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Those who suffer from knowledge silos (preventing from getting ideas
across) report waiting on answers and having to repeat themselves. The
frequency of their knowledge silo encounter is high, and they cannot
find the information they need. Again, wasted valuable time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Finally, mental health is a central predictor, but its predictive
power is relatively low. The strongest connection from mental health to
the rest of the network is a negative path to “I am able to quickly find
answers to my questions with existing tools and resources”. So, those
suffering from mental health issues report being unable to find answers
quickly with the existing tools and resources.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The overall picture reveals a major potential problem: the waste of
time caused by knowledge silos and the lack of efficient communication
within organizations.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Knowledge silos hinder productivity, diminish innovation, cost money,
lead to low employee engagement, and ultimately lead to negative
customer experience.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="what-can-be-done-to-prevent-knowledge-silos"
class="section level3">
<h3>What can be done to prevent knowledge silos?</h3>
<div>
<p>First of all, this is a broad organizational culture issue, and I
will recite something that I learned at <a
href="https://hi.hofstede-insights.com/organisational-culture"
target="_blank">Hofstede Insights</a>: there is no universal culture
that is best for all organizations. The appropriate culture is
contingent on context and strategic goals. The optimal culture for an
organization should align with its business goals, and an organization’s
culture should support its strategy. Otherwise, there is a misalignment,
an incongruence, or a disconnect.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>If an organization promotes competition among teams, then it is
natural for information to be withheld. On the other hand, if an
organization promotes cooperation, then knowledge silos are an
obstacle.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>If an organization wants to eliminate knowledge silos, it is best to
incentivize collaboration. There are multiple ways of achieving this,
such as restructuring teams for cross-reporting, and providing
cross-training opportunities to foster stronger and more meaningful
relationships across employees. Incentivizing collaboration and
promoting transparency also enables different teams to understand how
their work impacts others and the business as a whole.</p>
